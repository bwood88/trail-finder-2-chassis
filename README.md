# trail-finder-2-chassis
This is a model of the RC4WD Trail Finder 2 Chassis.  This was modeled in Sketchup 2015 and then converted into various other file formats for use in other 3D programs.

## File structure
Each component/piece of the chassis has been modeled as in individual object, just as it is on the actual chassis.  In the root folder is the main sketchup file that has all of the pieces together.

There are sub folders for each component which contain multiple file formats.

## Use of these models
This work was done in an effort to create an open platform to model new pieces for this particular chassis.  For example a person could create a roll cage or exo cage for their Trail Finder 2.  From this chassis model they should easily be able to find mounting points and figure out how what they create will look and or fit.
