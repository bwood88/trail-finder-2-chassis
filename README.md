# Trail Finder 2 Chassis
This is a model of the RC4WD Trail Finder 2 Chassis.  This was modeled in Sketchup 2015 and then converted into various other file formats for use in other 3D programs.

## File structure
Each component/piece of the chassis has been modeled as in individual object, just as it is on the actual chassis.  In the root folder is the main sketchup file that has all of the pieces together.

There are sub folders for each component which contain multiple file formats.

## 3D printing
Some of these parts can be 3D printed through various services such as Shapeways, Sculpteo, etc.  They can also be printed on other types of PLA or ABS types of printers that are commercially available.  This includes desktop sized printers.  Results will vary based on the different printer resolutions and materials used in printing.

## Use of these models
This work was done in an effort to create an open platform to model new pieces for this particular chassis.  For example a person could create a roll cage or exo cage for their Trail Finder 2.  

From this chassis model it should be easy enough to be able to find mounting points and figure out how the piece(s) will attach to the chassis.

# Note
These models were created from measuring the actual pieces.  Due to various curves or other challenging aspects of the parts their measurements may not be 100% accurate.  Keep this in mind when using them for a real-world project.  The general deviation might be around +- 0.1mm.  As much as possible was done in varifying the measurements and using other elements of the chassis to measure against for correct placements.
